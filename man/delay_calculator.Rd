\title{Calculate the total infectiousness at each observed time point.}
\usage{
delay_calculator(
  observed_counts,
  x = NULL,
  dist_gamma = c(2.5, 2.5),
  delay_distn = NULL,
  xout = x
)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed_counts}{vector of the observed daily infection counts}

\item{x}{a vector of positions at which the counts have been observed. In an
ideal case, we would observe data at regular intervals (e.g. daily or
weekly) but this may not always be the case. May be numeric or Date.}

\item{dist_gamma}{Vector of length 2. These are the shape and scale for the
assumed serial interval distribution. Roughly, this distribution describes
the probability of an infectious individual infecting someone else after
some period of time after having become infectious.
As in most literature, we assume that this interval follows a gamma
distribution with some shape and scale.}

\item{delay_distn}{in the case of a non-gamma delay distribution,
a vector of delay probabilities may be passed here. These will be coerced
to sum to 1, and padded with 0 in the right tail if necessary.}

\item{xout}{a vector of positions at for which the results should be returned.
By default, this will be the same as \code{x}, but in the case that observations
are unequally spaced, alternatives may be desired. Note that \code{xout} must
satisfy \code{min(x) <= min(xout)} and \code{max(x) >= max(xout)}.}
}
\value{
A vector containing the total infectiousness at each
observed time point
}
\description{
The total infectiousness at each observed time point is calculated
by \eqn{\sum_{a=1}^t I_{t-s}w_s}, where \eqn{I} denotes the vector containing
all observed case counts, and \eqn{w} denotes the serial interval
distribution. The serial interval distribution expresses the probability
of the symptom onset of a secondary infection occurred a given
number of days after the primary infection
