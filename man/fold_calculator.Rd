\title{Helper function. Calculate the fold index for each `observed_counts`}
\usage{
fold_calculator(n, nfold)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{length of the sequence to partition from}

\item{nfold}{Integer. This the number of folds to conduct the leave-kth-out
cross validation. For leave-kth-out cross validation, every kth
observed_counts and their corresponding position (evenly or unevenly
spaced) are placed into the same fold. The first and last observed_counts are
not assigned to any folds. Smallest allowable value if `fold = 2`. It is
generally not recommended to set `fold` to a large number}
}
\value{
a vector of fold index at which the counts are distributed into folds
